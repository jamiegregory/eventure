# Eventure Services

This repository contains a lightweight implementation of:

- `event-core-service` with event lifecycle management and session entities.
- `scheduling-service` with proposal/validate/publish scheduling APIs, conflict rules, read model, and event emission.
- `notification-service` integration for attendee/speaker schedule change notices.

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
